# Declare a variable called meal and assign it the value 44.50
meal = 44.50

# Calculate the decimal value of 6.75%
tax_percentage = 6.75
tax = tax_percentage / 100

# Calculate the decimal value of 15%
tip_percentage = 15.0
tip = tip_percentage / 100

# Reassign meal to the value of itself + itself * tax
meal = meal + meal * tax

# Create a variable total that is equal to meal + meal * tip
total = meal + meal * tip

# Print out the value of total
print total
